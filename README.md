# Rectangle project
This project say whether rectagnles intersect each other and whether one of them located into another. And also calculate an area of their intersection if they intersect.

Examples of rectangles are shown in winforms 

To make a conclusion, let's enumerate all features of this project:

1. Return boolean value that says whether rectangles are intersected
2. Return an area of their intersection 
3. Return boolean value that say whether one of rectangles into another
